"""Compute fixed cross-border exchange from the NT2030 result databases.

Instead of reading the pre-baked ``Exports_*`` / ``H2Exports_*`` columns from the
per-zone Excel files (which assume a FIXED zone selection), this derives the
external exchange on the fly from the crossborder-flow parquet databases in
``inputs/`` for the ACTUAL selected zones: a border is treated as an internal
(optimised) line when both endpoints are in the selection, or as a fixed
external exchange when the neighbour is outside it.

Full specification: ``inputs/EXPORTS_CALCULATION.md``.

Sign convention (as in the guide): a produced series is a NET EXPORT, positive =
export out of the zone. The model wants a net INJECTION (import positive), so the
public entry point returns ``-net_export``.
